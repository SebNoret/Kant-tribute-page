# Kant-tribute-page

A simple HTML/CSS page created as a project from the legacy [Freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/) responsive design curriculum.
I choosed to create a tribute page to Immanuel Kant because I am a huge fan of some aspects of his philosophy.
I first created this page in french and I added an english version after for fun.
This porject uses only HTML and CSS and GULP to minify the files.
